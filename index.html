      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>As if the page title doesn't make it obvious, my name is Casey Idsinga.  I was born and raised in Vancouver, Washington and have lived nearly my whole life there.  I'm a suburban boy through and through.</p>

      <p>I am married to a beautiful lady named Brandy and have 3 children: Jasmine (11), Josiah (10), and Jewel (8).  They are amazing kids and a joy to be around</p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I've always been jealous of the person that knew exactly what they wanted to do with their life.  You know, those people that <em>always</em> wanted to be a pilot, or a doctor, or a tradesperson for that matter.  When asked what I want to "be" or do my typical response is "a trust fund kid".</p>

      <p>Inevitibaly I just kind of took the best opportunity that was in front of me at the time. For the last 12 years that opportunity was a job in sales at Nautilus. Inc.  I had never dreamed of working in a call center for a third of my life at this point.  However, it had a great culture, work/life balance, and earning opportunities.  And as they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. However, over the last 18 months or so, it was becoming clear that the earning potential benefit of employment there was starting to wane. </p>

      <p>Enter Epicodus.  During the last year and a half or so I had done some self study in coding.  Not enough to be proficient at anything, but enough to think that this is something I can do. After thoughtful consideration, financial planning, and of course, consent from my wife, I signed up for the course here at Epicodus and put in my notice at work.  It's sink or swim time.  <strong>There is no plan b!</strong> </p>
