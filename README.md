## Bugs and issues
Github doesn't seem to be updating additional pushes.  File on github are several iterations behind commits on local even though there was success messages upon pushes and commits.

## UPDATE to Bugs
Problem was with capitalization of file paths.  I originally re-pushed the project with corrected file paths but Github wasn't recognizing the changes.  I removed the problem folders from the project, re pushed, add the folders back in and pushed on final time, which fixed the issue.  Site should display properly as of 10/24/2019.

## Technologies Used

html and css were used to create this page.  Some stylings were provided by bootstrap.  Contains a link out to some of my original music!
